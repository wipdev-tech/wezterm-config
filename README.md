# `wipdev`'s WezTerm Configuration

This is a relatively minimal config for the
[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) terminal emulator.

## Installation

- If you don't care about the config being version-controlled, simply put a
copy of `.wezterm.lua` in your home directory.
- For syncing with this repo, I have it cloned at `~/.config/wezterm` (though
you can clone it anywhere you want). Then, I symlinked the config file into the
home directory. The command for this would be:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/wezterm/.wezterm.lua ~/
```
